## 🎯 Why Convert a Website into an Android App?

Many businesses and developers want an Android app version of their website without building a full native application from scratch. Using a WebView‑based Android app allows you to:

* Reach Android users through Google Play Store
* Reuse your existing website or web app
* Reduce development time and cost
* Maintain a single codebase (your website)

This **Android WebView Wrapper** is designed to be simple, fast, secure, and production‑ready.

## ⚡ Quick Setup (60 Seconds) — Android Studio

1. **File → Open...** and select the cloned `android-webview-wrapper` folder
2. Wait for Gradle sync to finish (progress bar at the bottom of the window)
3. Open `app/src/main/java/com/monstertechno/webview/config/AppConfig.java` (press `Shift` twice and type the filename to find it instantly) and change one line:
   ```java
   public static final String TARGET_WEBSITE_URL = "https://yourwebsite.com";
   ```
4. Click the green **Run ▶** button in the toolbar (or `Shift+F10` / `Ctrl+R`)

Your Android app will build and launch on your selected device/emulator instantly.

Prefer the terminal? Use the **Terminal** tab at the bottom of Android Studio:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

For renaming the package, branding (icon/splash), release signing, and Play Store publishing — all with Android Studio's built-in wizards — see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## 🌉 JavaScript Bridge (Native ⇄ Web Communication)

This wrapper exposes a native `AndroidBridge` object to every page loaded in the WebView, so your website's JavaScript can call native Android features directly — device info, toasts, vibration, notifications, biometric auth, file download/share, clipboard, and back-press control.

```javascript
if (typeof AndroidBridge !== 'undefined') {
  AndroidBridge.showToast('Hello from the web page!');
}
```

A full, documented reference with a **live test console for every method** ships in the app's assets:
[app/src/main/assets/bridge-docs.html](app/src/main/assets/bridge-docs.html)

To open it in the running app, point `TARGET_WEBSITE_URL` at it in `AppConfig.java`:

```java
public static final String TARGET_WEBSITE_URL = "file:///android_asset/bridge-docs.html";
```

then run `./gradlew assembleDebug` and install it — every button on the page calls the real native bridge live. See `app/src/main/assets/README.md` for the full list of bundled demo/reference pages, and `JavaScriptBridge.java` for the native implementation.
